        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Coquito is a traditional Christmas drink that originated in Puerto Rico. It is similar to eggnog, but it is made with coconut milk instead of milk. It is a thick and creamy drink that is served cold and usually garnished with cinnamon or nutmeg.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
            <li>2 large egg yolks, beaten</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can cream of coconut</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>½ cup white rum</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Combine evaporated milk and egg yolks in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Cook over the simmering water, stirring constantly, until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, and reaches a temperature of 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).</li>
