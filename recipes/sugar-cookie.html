        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This sugar cookie recipe is quick and easy to make with simple ingredients. They are delicious as-is or with candies mixed in. My friend uses chocolate mints on top, and they taste great!</p>

            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
